A list of all categories is available from the following url in JSON:

https://api.figshare.com/v2/categories

The default defined_type is `dataset`.

When adding authors, bear in mind that the user who uploads the article will
AUTOMATICALLY be added to the authors list.  So don't put this in unless you
want to have it duplicated.
